# Overview

This course serves as a graduate-level introduction to statistical/machine learning. It will cover common techniques to process and analyze large, often structured, data. The primary emphasis will be on methods for supervised learning, parametric methods, non-parametric methods, tree-based methods, neural networks, and ensembles. We will then briefly cover techniques for unsupervised learning, such as clustering and topic models. We will conclude with a discussion of machine learning methods for statistical inference and extensions based on classroom interest.

# Learning Objectives

The goal of statistical/machine learning is prediction and description, especially in the context of large, perhaps unstructured, data sets.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

1. Choose and apply algorithms to data relevant to your research interests
2. Evaluate the appropriateness of machine learning applications in academia, government, industry, and civil society
3. Continue learning about cutting-edge developments in the field on your own

# Prerequisites

Formally, students should have taken POLI_SCI 403 (Probability and Statistics), POLI_SCI 405 (Linear Models), or equivalent familiarity with these topics and their application in statistical software like `R`, `Python`, or `Julia`. Students who do not meet these requirements should seek express approval from the instructor to take this class.

Informally, I expect willingness to learn new, complex material in a semi-supervised manner.^[The joke here is that semi-supervised learning exists but it is a bit of a misnomer.] Given the breadth of the topics covered in this class, instruction cannot go much further than a mere introduction, so it is up to students to delve deeper on topics relevant to their respective research interests.

The usual norms of a graduate seminar also apply. You should participate actively, productively, and respectfully in our meetings. We are jointly responsible for creating an environment conducive to learning and discovery.

# Requirements

## Reading

There is no single required textbook, but we will draw heavily from:

::: {.callout-note}
## **Textbooks**

- **ESL:** Hastie, Trevor, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. 2017. [*The Elements of Statistical Learning*](https://www.statlearning.com). Springer

- **ISL:** James, Gareth, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani. 2021/2023. [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](https://www.statlearning.com). Springer

- **TM**: Kuhn, Max and Julia Silge. 2023. [*Tidy Modeling with R*](https://www.tmwr.org). O'Reilly
:::

The initials at the beginning denote how we will refer to each book throughout the course materials. These are all textbooks that are **FREE** to read or download online. ISL has editions with code in `R` and `Python`, the content is the same otherwise, you should choose whichever suits your goals.

Additional readings will be linked in the Schedule section below and are usually available through Northwestern library subscriptions.


## Computing

We will use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) to work on assignments and classroom demonstrations.  The advantage of R is that it is free and open source, meaning that you will be able to apply everything you learn in this course anywhere else. The disadvantage is a somewhat steep learning curve. I believe the investment is worthwhile for anyone working with data or in data-adjacent careers. You are welcome to use different software for statistical computing, but I cannot guarantee I will be able to help with troubleshooting.

You can install R and RStudio on your personal computer, which is the preferred use case. You can use [this link](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/r-and-rstudio/) for installation instructions on Windows and MacOS. See [this link](https://levente.littvay.hu/chromebook/) for installation instructions on Chromebooks, which is a bit more involved.

<!-- Could we one day have a posit cloud server? -->
You can also use [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) to access RStudio from any web browser. A free account should suffice for the purposes of this course and has the advantage of letting you access your work across devices.

If you ever need more computing resources than what a personal computer or a free Posit Cloud account allow, you should consider requesting access to the [Quest Analytic Nodes](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/computing/quest/quest-analytics-nodes.html) from Northwestern IT. I do not anticipate this to be relevant for this course, but it may be useful in the future.


# Evaluation

Your final grade in this course will depend on the following:


## Participation

This course does not formally require attendance, but I do expect the usual level of accountability required in a graduate seminar. That means attending class, doing the reading, asking questions, and working to foster a productive learning environment for everyone. Your participation inside and outside the classroom will be marked as satisfactory or unsatisfactory by the end of the quarter. If your participation leans toward an unsatisfactory mark, I will notify you by the end of Week 6 and give you feedback on how to improve.

## Exploration assignments




## Data paper



# Grading

This course uses a labor-based grading agreement, commonly known as contract grading. In this course, instead of being given a final grade based on how “good” your submitted assignments are, your final grade will be based on the amount of labor you put into the course. The goal is to decouple grades from performance and emphasize learning and effort.

You will get a default grade if you meet the contract. It will go lower if you miss parts of the contract, it will go higher if you meet the baseline plus other criteria.

To meet the baseline grading contract (B+), you should:




To get an A-, you should...

To get an A, you should...

Your grade will go below a B+ if you miss work. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing on a case-by-case basis, the following criteria outlines how deviating from the baseline contract will impact your grade (assuming everything else constant):

[HERE]

If many of the criteria for missed work apply, you will get the lowest grade applicable.

By signing up for this course, you accept the terms of the grading contract. We will discuss potential amendments in Week 1. Amendments to the grading contract beyond this point should be agreed upon unanimously by students and the instructional team.

# Northwestern University Syllabus Standards

This course follows the [Northwestern University Syllabus Standards](https://www.registrar.northwestern.edu/registration-graduation/northwestern-university-syllabus-standards.html). Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with this information.

# Use of Generative AI Systems

The use of generative artificial intelligence in this course is encouraged as long as it is used to amplify humans instead of replacing them. Any form of cheating, including improper use of content generated by artificial intelligence, constitutes a violation of Northwestern’s academic integrity policy.

Copilot is the [University’s supported artificial intelligence service](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/about/news-events/2024/microsoft-copilot-available-university-community.html). When using Copilot while actively logged in with a Northwestern account, data is stored securely in Northwestern’s Microsoft tenant, and Microsoft will not use it for product improvement or to train its AI models.
